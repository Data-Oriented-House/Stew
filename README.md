Stew is a minimalistic data-oriented entity-component module. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Roblox Studio game engine. It was designed to be small, efficient, non-restrictive, and easy to use. Just like this README. You can find the source code on GitHub, or look at the API documentation on the moonwave website.
